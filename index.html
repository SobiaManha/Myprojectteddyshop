<p>
    A teddy bear is a type of toy that looks like a bear. The teddy bear normally looks like a cub or baby bear. It became popular in Germany and the United States in 1902 when the name was invented. In Russia, bears were used as children's toys and were the subject of folklore or stories, long before the 20th century.
    A teddy bear is a stuffed toy that resembles a bear, usually a baby or cub bear. Teddy bears are often given to children as gifts, but they can also be used to show affection, sympathy, or congratulations to adults. They are popular around the world and have been featured in stories, songs, and films.
